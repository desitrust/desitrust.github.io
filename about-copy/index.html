								</h4>
								<p>Our country still has a large population of farmers, handloom weavers who form the majority of workforce. With sustainable practices in these two sectors, we could improve our chances of facing an impending disaster. Desi strives to make the villages stronger, with an ideal amalgamation of physical labour and progressive thinking and ideals. With promoting sustainable agricultural practices, village industries like handlooms and handicrafts, we could make our villages self sufficient, reduce migration and retain our natural resources. To do this, we have to overcome the barriers of caste discrimination, gender biases and superstitions that are deep rooted in our villages today. India stands at an interesting juncture today with a large population of people still practicing traditional practices which need to be revived and promoted, since they are based on the principles of sustainability. </p>

								</h4>
								<p>Sustainability forms the core of Desi Philosophy. It is committed to environment by ensuring sustainable practices are followed. The Natural dyes are extracted from locally available by products of farming and are available in abundance in the nearby area. Indigo, Pomegranate, Myrobalan, Kasimkari, Arecanut juice, Jack wood and other natural materials are used for dyeing of yarn. The water used for dyeing is treated and reused to water plants. There are no harmful chemicals used in the entire process, thus making this environmentally friendly. The fabric is hand woven and the entire processes uses very less electricity, making this economically viable and sustainable. </p>

								</h4>
								<p>The current world is moving towards a market economy, with literature, education, society and culture becoming commercialized and leaning towards globalization. With most of our people turning towards western culture and practices, we have lost our connection with our land, with our ancestors, with our tradition. We are caught in a materialistic world, where money rules. Human relationships are dwindling and we are becoming more and more distant from our roots. With extensive industrialization, we have indiscriminately exploited our natural resources, destroyed our forests and polluted our water sources. This has increased our reliance on machines and with peak oil crisis becoming a reality, we are standing at the edge of a massive collapse of our economy leading to huge environmental disasters. With growing consumerism among the people, our society has collectively forgotten our villages, which were once considered our backbones. </p>

									<a class="has-text-dark" href="/">Affordability</a>
								</h4>
								<p>DESI makes clothes affordable. The profit margins are low and the profits are redistributed to all the members of the community. The pricing of the products are such that it appeals to the middle class urban as well as the consumers in the towns. Before colonization, our country had a rich tradition of Handlooms and it was worn by everyone as everyday wear. Post colonization, with the advent of mills and powerlooms, the handloom weavers lost their livelihood, thereby making the mill clothes more accessible. When handlooms were revived, recently, it is done only in smaller pockets, with high costs, making them elitist and unaffordable the most people. DESI aims to improve accessibility of handloom to a larger population by keeping the designs simple, the entire production in rural areas and reducing the overhead costs. It employs low-skilled and medium-skilled weavers who are the worst affected and producing coarse fabric that can be used for everyday wear. </p>

								</h4>
								<p>The Charaka collective is formed by local women, is completely run by them and all the women involved are members of this collective. Decentralized units are setup in and around Heggodu for women who find it difficult to travel to Charaka. Most of the raw materials required (natural raw materials used for dyeing) are procured locally.The finished products are sold through Desi outlets all across Karnataka state. The beauty of this whole model is that the women pay themselves the salaries based on the work they accomplish. Emphasis is on the women&#39;s all round welfare and not just treating them as workers who take home wages. Every woman is a member of the collective and is directly responsible for the success of the organization. They have internalized the culture of the organization and working here gives them a sense of pride.</p>

									<a class="has-text-dark" href="/">Simplicity</a>
								</h4>
								<p>DESI believes in simplicity, be it in the clothes, the shop ambience or in their administration. The designs are developed by designers who have understood the culture of the people at Charaka and have tailored their designs to suit their abilities without pushing them out of their comfort zone. At the same time, sufficient space is given to the artisans at Charaka to explore their creativity and come up with their own designs. The fabric is simple, coarse and easy to maintain. The dyes used are all of plant origin and are not harmful for our health. The organization is run by people who have been working with Charaka and Desi for a long time and have grown organically to managerial positions. Complex systems like outsourced weaving units across 15 locations is well co-ordinated without having to deploy any software to manage them. There is no hurry for growth; the emphasis is on sustaining the model rather than expansion.</p>

				<h2 id="developing-ecologically-sustainable-industry">Developing Ecologically Sustainable Industry</h2>
<p>DESI means indigenous in some Indian languages. It is also an acronym for Developing Ecologically Sustainable Industries. DESI is not just a handloom store, it is much more. Desi is a registered trust. It strives to provide decent livelihood for handloom workers, work in ecologically sensitive areas and introduce alternate forms of employment, provide a economically viable alternative to villagers to ensure they do not migrate, focus on eco-friendly practices and advocate rights of handloom workers.</p>
<p>Desi today has 16 outlets across Karnataka, with an annual turnover of more than 6 crores. One of its main suppliers, Charaka Womens' multipurpose co-operative Society accounts for 60% of the products sold at Desi Stores. Apart from this, Desi also sources handmade products - handlooms, Khadi, handicrafts, organic food products from across the country. It showcases traditional crafts from specific regions of the country like Sarees from Chanderi, Dhurries (Carpets) from Warrangal, wooden toys from Channapatna. Desi stores also host a book section with an envious collection of books about tradition, sustainability and literature in Kannada and English.</p>
<p>All Desi stores exude a warm atmosphere with customers made to feel like guests at home. Most of the Desi stores are in residential area in houses, away from busy streets. Most of our customers are already family and they visit the stores regularly, not just for shopping but sometimes to just speak to the staff! The entire family has something for each member and a lot of our customers visit with their families and friends. A visit to a store would make one more knowledgeable about handlooms, natural dyes and the philosophy behind Desi.</p>
<p>Desi not just provides a market for handloom and handmade products but is also involved in advocacy work in rural areas, support various grassroot movements and influence policy making.</p>
<h2 id="how-it-started">How it started</h2>
<p>It all started in the year 1995, when a group of enlightened intellectuals came together and formed a cultural group called &ldquo;Kavi Kavya Trust&rdquo;. It was a trust formed for cultural activities. Since, it was registered as a trust, it was also allowed to take up community projects. One such project was training the Anganwadi workers in villages in and around Shivamogga. During this, the members traveled extensively across the district and they spent considerable time understanding the local culture, lifestyle, folklore, their problems, their social issues and the economy.</p>
<p>In the process they also understood that the villagers depended largely on agriculture. The hilly region, once rich in rain forests, was getting converted to agriculture lands at an alarming rate, putting great stress on the eco system. Something had to be done to reverse this, and soon. The villagers needed an alternative form of employment which was ecologically friendly. Kavi Kavya setup a weaving center on an experimental basis in order to prove that handloom weaving can be viable and profitable in this region. We must remember that handloom weaving is not natural to this region.</p>
<p>In 1996, Kavi Kavya Trust handed over the entire infrastructure thus developed to the women workers. Thus, Charaka society was registered as a women&rsquo;s collective with a group of 13 womens and two sewing machines. The women started producing handwoven garments. The trust told the women that as long as they produced quality stuff, the trust would market it and take responsibility of clearing the bills within a fortnight.</p>
<p>Thus began the marketing experiment which resulted in setting up of another trust called DESI.</p>
<h2 id="relationship-with-charaka">Relationship with Charaka</h2>
<p>Charaka is the production unit for naturally dyed handloom products and Desi is the main market for Charaka. Desi was established to provide an urban market for the Charaka products. Desi can be considered as a marketing unit, an extension of Charaka. Both are sister organizations and have a very close-knit relationship between them. Some of the Charaka managers are also in the board of Trustees of Desi Trust and vice-versa. Desi provides constant marketing inputs to Charaka to innovate. Charaka in-turn provides the solid technical background and experience that yields credibility to Desi. The staff of Desi are trained at Charaka in technical processes and the members of Charaka Women&rsquo;s society are sent on exposure visit to Desi stores to get an understanding of the market needs.</p>
<p>The profits from Desi go back to the members of the Charaka co-operative as yearly bonus based on the scale of production by each member. The Desi staff also receive yearly bonus depending on their performance. In this way, the profits earned are distributed to all the workers, in recognition of their contribution.</p>
