<p>Kaimagga Satyagraha, a non-violent protest was taken up by weavers of Karnataka, supported by weavers from Seemandhra. This is going on since a year, included hunger strikes, Padayatra. The weavers are fighting for their rights to livelihood, some Key Demands were kept forth before State Government. The loss of livelihood of handloom weavers due to adulteration of fabric is one of the key problems they face. Government is giving additional incentives to powerloom weavers like subsidized electricity and other benefits. Handloom weavers are left in the lurch, to fend for themselves, with no benefits whatsoever. Even the single lamp that is used for lighting in their weaving sheds, which is their only electricity consumption is not subsidized. Giving incentives to powerloom sector is becoming a death knell for handloom sector. So the main demand of the weavers has been &ldquo;Do not kill Handloom&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The Kaimagga Satyagraha was expanded to include all organizations working towards sustainability into this campaign. Sustainability in agriculture, environment, labour, gender, language, folklore, culture and education, along with Khadhi and handlooms, being the motto. Badanavalu Satyagraha was a joint campaign of all consumers and producers of a sustainable production range. It was a joint campaign of the city people and the village poor.</p>
<p>Badanavalu, the origin place of this Satyagraha, is a small village situated at the southern end of Mysore district, adjoining Chamarajanagar, in Karnataka. It is a perpetually drought prone area. Back in 1925, a well-known Gandhian, by name Tagadoor Ramachandra Rao, started a Khadi and Village Industries production centre here. Gandhiji has visited this centre a couple of times and stayed there.</p>
<p>As part of this Satyagraha, meetings, workshops, street performances and visual art campaigns were conducted all over Karnataka. Several Padyatras (long march), starting from various nearby locations, culminated at Badanawal for the National Convention for Sustainable Living on the 19th of April, 2015.</p>
